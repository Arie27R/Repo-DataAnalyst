# Data Analysis Projects Repository

Welcome to my repository of data analysis projects! ðŸš€ Here, you'll find a collection of my projects created using Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`). Each project focuses on different data analysis techniques, ranging from statistical analysis to data visualization using Python.

## Prerequisites

To view and run the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository, you'll need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. I recommend using **Anaconda**, which includes Jupyter and many other useful data analysis tools.

### Recommended Installation Steps:

1. **Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)**:  
   Anaconda is a distribution that includes Python and Jupyter Notebook, as well as a variety of essential libraries for data science projects.
2. **Open Jupyter Notebook**:  
   Once Anaconda is installed, you can launch Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda Navigator or by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
3. **Open Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
4. **Open the project**:
   From the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project folder and open the desired .ipynb file.

### Requirements
The specific requirements for each project (e.g., Python libraries) are listed at the beginning of each notebook. Most projects use popular libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, which are included in Anaconda.
